      <h1>Welcome to the AI Card Game</h1>
      <p>
        In this game, you will explore various applications of facial
        recognition technology and its level of acceptance. Your task is to
        arrange the cards in the "Card Placement" area based on their levels of
        acceptance, from most acceptable to least acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game includes a set of cards, each representing a specific
        application of facial recognition technology. Your goal is to identify
        card combos that are believed to have similar levels of acceptance. Card
        combos consist of three cards placed together that reflect similar
        perspectives on AI acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drag and drop the cards into the "Card Placement" area in the order you
        think represents their level of acceptance, with the most acceptable at
        the top and the least acceptable at the bottom. As you place the cards,
        pay attention to the combos you can create, as they will earn you bonus
        points!
      </p>
      <p>
        Score points by placing cards correctly and achieving card combos. You
        will earn 10 points for each correctly placed card and an additional 50
        points for each achieved card combo. Aim for the highest score possible!
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you ready? Start arranging the cards and explore the different
        levels of acceptance of facial recognition technology!
